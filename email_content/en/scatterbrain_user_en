Hold your horses!

Did you forget to create your account?

For privacy reasons, we cannot directly display messages in the app like 'Your email already exists' or 'Your email is unknown' (in compliance with GDPR regulations). That’s why we’re sending you this special email, just for the scatterbrains!

You need to create an account in the app first, that’s the other button!

Thank you for your understanding,
The BrickAssist Team
